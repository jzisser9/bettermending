A fork of the bettermending Minecraft plugin by hornta.

This version of bettermending expands the list of valid repairable items when an Experience Orb is picked up. Now, any item in the player's inventory with the Mending enchantment will be eligible for repair when an XP orb is picked up.

# bettermending
Improve the Mending mechanic by only mending damaged items while still keeping the native logic.
